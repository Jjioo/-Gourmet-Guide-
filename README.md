The app combines modern web technologies with machine learning to create a user-friendly and intelligent recipe recommendation system. It leverages Angular's component-based architecture for the frontend and NestJS's modular structure for the backend, with MongoDB providing flexible data storage for recipes. The ML component uses TensorFlow.js to generate embeddings for ingredients and recipes, enabling sophisticated matching of user preferences to recipe characteristics.
